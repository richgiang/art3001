        BANG BANG BANG
        <br>
        <br>
        A groan. 
        <br>
        <br>
        He yells from his bed that he didn't do it.
        <br>
        Who else could it be?
        <br>
        <br>
        He comes to the door and explains that he doesn't remember exactly, but he's pretty sure he didn't break it. He says he <br> dropped a weight the other day but is pretty sure it didn't fall on the scale.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sus.
        <br>
        <br>
        Actually, no. I was there and he didn't break anything.
        <br>
        <br>
        Left with no options we open the bag to make sure of its contents. First thing we notice is that the knot is tied beautifully.
        <br>
        <br>
        Definitely not Andy, he was a maintenance man, his method for knots is whatever works.
        <br>
        <br>
        Chaos ensues, we all start to question each other. We go over a detailed list of visitors we've had and what they did while here. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We're about to start calling them.
