                        Fun fact: this entire semester for specific rasons I haven't been able to drink any alcohol. With that have come experiences where I am the only sober person in a room. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I absolutely have no qualms with this fact. Time and time again people have apologized to me because they offered me a drink forgetting my mandatory sobriety, and I try to remind them that I'm okay with it and that they don't have to apologize. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Coming from a family with a history of substance abuse, I wondered how I would fare with 6 months of sobriety following 6 months of very much non-sober activities. So far, I think I can say I didn't inherit any of the genes that would potentially lead to a rather detrimental dependence. Of course, this is incredibly small scale compared to what my familial counterparts have experienced, but I can say that I'm content with my state of sobriety. This sounds like I might have a huge problem, but I promise I'm getting to the actual point. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What this stint of sobriety has really shown me is that I really chose the right place to go for college. What I mean by that is what I've noticed is that even though the circumstances were the absolute worst: I'm on a medicine that amplifies depressive thoughts, seasonal depression was at its peak, and we're in the 12th almosst 13th month of a global pandemic, I'm still content and for the most part happy. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think the reason for being happy despite all of the negative factors is due to two separate but not unrelated situations. The first of those, is the nature of Ohio State and who it attracts. In short, Ohio State attracts an extremely diverse set of human beings. I happen to be in the "Spiteiful Failed Ivy League Aspirations" category (I know, gross). But basically, I thought for a while that I didn't belong here. However, over time, for a number of reasons I can't quantify, I have come to love Ohio State. Not because of the university itself, but because of the people. That sounds like an incredibly common and vague answer to the "Why Ohio State?". In my situation, it's not my reason for choosing to come to Ohio State, it's my reason for <i>staying</i> at Ohio State. The people that also fell into my category over their first few years here have also found their reasons for staying, and that's something I have fed off of. Learning the stories of these amazing peeople and getting to interact with them on an intimate level has inspired me to constantly uncover more of my "Why?". To sum up, I basically just love all of my friends. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second factor is more of an internal one. The one thing I will say is that my time at Ohio State has given me pause. I thought I knew who I was leaving high school. I was eager to take what I thought was a polished, finished version of myself to a new city with all new types of peoplee and conquer the world. Now I know that I was dead wrong. My time at Ohio State has gifted me time to reflect and figure out what's really important to me. Figuring out what's important to me has changed the way I present myself and how I interact with everyone, really just my whole personality. Without getting into it too much, I just feel very comfortable here. Comfortable enough to take risks and continue to push myself beyond what I previously thought were my boundaries. What I've established here at Ohio State is a very strong baseline of thinking and perspective shifting that I believe will allow me to really succeed in my new definition of success that doesn't rely on societal pressures and what high school me imagined. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I can't thank Ohio State and the people here enough, and I appreciate every single moment I get to spend here. Thank you to my dermatologist for putting me on a medicine that doesn't allow me to drink.
