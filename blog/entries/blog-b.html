    <h1>Blog B</h1>
    <p>
        This past week was interesting in my enagement with the content. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The discussion we had involved my area of supposed) expertise. <br> I felt as though I was able to thoroughly engage with the content since <br> I was so familiar and had examples I could relate to the content with. <br> What I found interesting was the different perspective that I was able to <br> interepret the same information from. In the communications school there <br> is often a lot of linear, homogeneous thinking and repetition of theories and <br> pieces which makes it seem like I'm siloed in one way of thinking. But with <br> this new information I feel like I've gotte a fresh take on a subject I'm passionate <br> about and feel motivated to learn more. With that being said, it makes me rethink <br> my approach to my major. I used to think I wouldn't be able to pursue the careers <br> directly linked to my major, but now I think there's an ability to pursue many <br> different paths just from one set of information (i.e., abstracting HCI into a career <br> in startups). I now kind of have a renewed intrest in an area I previously wrote off <br> as something I would never continue long-term. 
        <br>

        I recognize how the content of the discussions have kind of matched the content of the <br> workshops. I like that and think it works well, especially since styling is where I <br> probably shine the best. I appreciate aesthetically pleasing (but also unexpectedly <br> provocative styles too) methods of information delivery so having the tools to do that <br> is very inspiring to me. I'm really taking the time to delve into projects because I feel <br> like I need to take the time to really engage with the curriculum and make sure that I <br> take the skills I develop with me. I feel good about my current mastery and want to <br> explore more. This class has given me more faith in my coding abilities so I'm looking <br> forward to seeing what I can make.

        For my Exercise 1 I wanted to take the time to really flesh out a story. Oftentimes I'm <br> the type of person to just jump in head first into a project without planning, but for this <br> one I put in the effort to map out the structure of the logic prior to actually starting to <br> code. By doing this I understood just how much time and effort can go into just one <br> page of a website. For the subject, I feel as though my strength was in storytelling, so I <br> tried to get it to follow how the events actually played out as closely as possible. While <br> coding I found myself getting lost and excited about it and wanted to make sure it was <br> my best effort. In the end, I shared it with my roommates that were mentioned and they <br> all enjoyed getting to explore it.
