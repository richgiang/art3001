                        To be honest I've been a bit busy finishing my food while preserving my mental health. I think it's evident with the fact that I never submitted Blog J or K on time. However, I've gotten over the hump and I think I can see the horizon.

                        With that being said, I can see just how free I'm going to be senior year and how absolutely excited I am to be. My senior year of high school I believed that I needed to be as involved as possible and taking the biggest workload possible. I have so many regrets about the perspectives I adopted during my high school days so now I'm going to live out a reality that high school me would never dream of.

                        I took on a lot of responsibilities this past year because I felt that I had more to learn. Now being on the other side of it, I've realized that I've grown past the need for accolades or titles and I'm all the more happy for it. It's something that I've been working on since high school and I'm proud to say that I was able to achieve it.

                        I don't regret my involvements throughout college, but what I do regret is not indulging in the fact that I love learning. After taking classes that are actually stimulating and exciting I want more of it so I tried to schedule my classes next semester around what I think would be interesting instead of what would look good. This leads me to believe that I want to pursue a graduate degree (also the fact I want to be a professor someday). Learning is something I've always enjoyed, it's just that my enthusiasm fluctuates at a rate and magnitude that is heavily dependent on the instructor. My past three years I've been someone that never went to office hours or was heavily involved in classes because I viewed them as a means to an end, a gateway to something more. In general, I've been trying to focus less on what's past the theoretical doorway and more on the actualy process itself. With that being said, I'm looking forward to what I can learn senior year and in graduate school.

                        So that was the long answer to what I did over break, but in summary I finished up projects, involvements, and responsibilities. I dropped my screenwriting minor and picked up a studio art minor. I scheduled with professors that I'm excited to learn from. I walked through the door and I'm excited to see what's next.
