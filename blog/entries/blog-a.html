            If I'm going to be honest this is the first class where I'm genuinely ecstatic to learn more.

            The last time I had written a single line of code was junior year of high school and it when I wrote it I was relieved.

            Coding and anything even remotely associted gave me anxiety so I vowed to never do it again I even gave up on any dreams of being a CSE major and going into IT.

            Because of this, for so long I was hesitant to lean into something that had anything remotely to do with coding within the HCI space. Constantly, I would see internship postings that called for proficiency in "HTML, CSS, and Javascript". Going into this year I knew that I wanted to finally face my fears and challenge myself to start over and try it from a different angle.

            When I saw that this class was going to teach the exact languages that I want to learn and that it had a creative spin I knew I wanted to take it. To be honest, I'm surprised that it's not an elective in the HCI curriculum because it covers both technical and theory tied to current events. A lot of the material we've gone over so far I've heard in my HCI classes before. On the first day after learning everything we were going to be doing this semester I immediately told all of my roommates about it because I was finally exicted to learn how to code again. I'm looking forward to exploring the software, learn more, and develop a skill. This class was exactly what I was looking for in a coding class.

            When we started our first exercise and I opened Visual Studio, so many memories came flooding back and I had a mix of anxiety and excitement. I knew I wanted to learn more, but the interface brought back so many memories of my old coding days when it was the only class I wasn't good at. There's a meme or trope of the burntout gifted kid that has been told their whole life they're good at something and then when they're not immediately good at something they want to quit it. Yeah, that was me with coding. In my classes I felt so inadequate and back then I didn't know how to ask for help so I just failed (or cheated) project after project. It came during a long stint of mental health issues, and contributed to my worsening state. The conflation of the two subjects led to me associating my bad mental health state with the act of coding and I pushed it to the back of my mind.

            Coming into this class I've grown a lot as a person academically and emotionally, so I'm confident I'll be able to ask for help when needed and use all of my resources and get genuinely exicted to learn a new skill. For me, personable and approachable professors are crucial, so I should be good for this semester! Overall, I'm very excited and hungry for more!
