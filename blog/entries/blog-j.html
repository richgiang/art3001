                        I'm realizing that there are going to be a lot of firsts throughout these next few years. My first time living alone, having a full-time job, living outside of Ohio, my first time being far away from family.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short: it'll probably go by super fast and I won't have time to process it, but nonetheless it's coming.
                    </p>

                        Sometimes I start to struggle with whether I actually like to do new things all the time or if I just tell others and myself that I do. Over time I've seen myself brand myself as someone who always loves to do new things. Well I think that's becuase I gennuinely believe I do enjoy new things often. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, simultaneously I feel as though I am always looking for a routine for stability. Something to ground me into comfort. For example, at the beginning of this year I tried to make pourover coffee every morning while reading. I succeeded for about a month, amd eventually I stopped but that's besides the point. What I'm trying to say is that I crave both stability and novelty. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Or I believe you could say that I crave stability IN novelty. I'm someone who tries to fold in new moments into rituals and routines periodically. I cycle through different habits in order to keep things fresh and engaging for me.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe that this may come to bite me in the ass in the future considering the fact that I don't see myself holding the same job at the same company for more than 5 years. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This leads me to believe that the only way that I'll be able to find peace is through founding my own company/project. This seems contrary since I'll have to stick with the company long enough for it to become successful, but I think if it's my project I'll be invested enough to seee it through. I've been notorious for abandoning projects early, but I've been working on that vice a lot and I think I'll be ready in the near future.
