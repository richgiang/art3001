                    This past week was kind of a whirlwind of a lot of realization. Among the first of those relizations is how busy I'm going to be from now until the end of the semester. But, to be honest, I feel that every semester, so I should probably reckon with being busy for a long time (and learning to enjoy it so it doesn't actually feel like I'm "busy"). With that, I feel like I should make a decision on my outlook about being busy. For instance, with this class I want to be busy. Whenever I have idle time I want to be working on a project. 
                    <br>
                    Simultaneously, however, I know that:
                    <br>
                    1. I have a lot to learn and
                    <br>
                    2. There is a lot of work to be done.
                    <br>
                    Traditionally, I'm not someone who is too good at keeping to long-term projects. I get distracted easily, it's like I'm a squirrel sometimes. But, I know that I have been growing over the past few years into someone who can actually plan and undertake large-scale projects by myself. Over the past few years I have been actively trying to alter my mindset to appreciate the opportunities that I've been granted here at Ohio State and in general as opposed to groaning everytime I have to go to a meeting or complete an assignment. This class is one of those in which I'm searching for (and finding) the purpose and reason behind all of our assignments and the way they're handled so I can get the absolute most out of them.
                    <br>
                    With that ing said, I had an amazing time going to the Art + Tech Working Group workshop on Wednesday. It was nice playing in a relaxed envrironment then doing work afterwards. I was excited and determined to nail down the horizontal scrolling before I left which I did and was very satisfied with. Every time I've had a breakthrough with my project it has been so rewarding. I'm also showing one of my roommates everything we're doing in class because he is extremely interested in this kind of content (unfortunately, he didn't have room to take it with me), so it's really enjoyable being able to talk about the content outside of class overall. 
                    <br>
                    Lastly, with Lunar New Year coming and passing this week, it hs made me really appreciative of the fact that I now can say I've had a Vietnamese/Vietnamese-American professor. Prior to this class, I probably have had a total of maybe two professors who were P.O.C., but having two professors who are such great examples of P.O.C. excellence (especially SEA and Viet excellence) is definitely a huge part of my motivation when it comes to this class. Thank you both!
