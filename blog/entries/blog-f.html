                        Over this past week I've been working on a separate site/coding project aside from Project 1 for my job. I'm the Managing Editor for Design for the Lantern and we're about to launch a special project that covers the stories of Black Voices within the Ohio State community. It's really exciting because the Lantern is actively engaging with the Black community on campus by collaborating with the Black and Bold Magazinne. It's a milestone, and I'm glad I'm here to help facilitate it.

                        With this project, I volunteered myself to design the landing page for the storis that are being written. I was a bit nervous at first because I only know as much HTML, CSS, and Javascript that I've learned during our workshops and whatever supplemental materials I've engaged with as I've worked through my exercises and project 1. However, because of the extra work I've put into Project 1 I felt confident enough to volunteer myself and dive headfirst into the project.

                        When I had my first meeting to talk about the concept with the Managing Editor for Digital Content, I was a bit nervous because for a split second I felt like I was in over my head. In the conversation he talked about the structure of the site that he was expecting and how he thought I would use boostrap since that is what he was familiar with. But, I mocked up the site in figma quickly, shared my vision with him and we kind of had a silent agreement that I knew what I was doing.

                    <p>
                        When I first sat down to tackle it, I was a bit overwhelmed, but I took a breath and remembered all of the times that Dalena had demonstrated how to format the structure of the HTML based on the mockup. I ended up using flexboxes which is something that I'm not as familiar with compared to grids. As I started and continued to code the site, I got more and more excited because I realized that I was competent in being able to put into practice and bring to fruition the vision I had. I had never done that before in the context of coding on my own so this was a huge milestone for me. Everytime I've worked on it since I have learned something new. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I think one of the greatest things about coding in my opinion is the ability to just look up the desired action or result that I'm looking for and finding that there is a wealth of open-source knowledge and examples to help guide me through it. I did that when I had to make the site mobile compatible. When I did figure it out, it was extremely rewarding and made me even more excited about the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My biggest takeaway from this experience is that after this class is over I have the confidence to pursue and execute on projects entirely on my own from start to finish. That's not something I could say a few years ago. I feel as though the end of this semester will be a tipping point for me in creating work that I actually genuinely enjoy and want to make a career out of.
