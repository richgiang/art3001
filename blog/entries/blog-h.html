                        As I finish up the most stressful week of the semester yet. I've come to the realization that I'm coming around to altering my priorities, but this reflection has only come after many observations. Living with seven roommates and getting to experience them in every form virtually 24 hours per day, I start to realize that I'm not alone in these conflicts that pop up irregularly, yet also consistently. It's a back-and-forth, a pull between two mindsets. It can be as big as deciding where to live for the summer, to whether or not you're going to tag along to the 9:00pm Target run. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You see, when I approach any decision there are usually two options. Well, that seems a bit too obvious, but allow me to explain. This is something that I haven't been able to form complete thoughts around until this year. It came suddenly, yet ferociously when a mentor nonchalantly mentioned it to me during a virtual call (this phenomenon often occurs when people say something that my entire subconscious is co-opted and overridden with thoughts that explode into hundreds of differrent directions and it absolutely distracts me from what they're saying, and often they don't realize the effect they've had so I silently internalize while they continue and I nod along). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Look, I'm rambling a bit, but trust me, it's important because that's just who I am and I presume you've come here to learn more about who I am, so please stay with me. What he said is that a friend of his told him that there are only ever two main drivers behind every human's decision making. Now, that sounds awfully reductionist, I get it, but it actually makes sense to me if you take the time to really think about it (at times with some extrapolation). Those two main drivers are love and fear. Wow, I know how cliché, but honestly, I believe it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using my examples from earlier I can break it down. Where I live for the summer can be either be driven by my fear that I'm missing out on an opportunity to add something to the "experience" section of my resumé, or it can be driven for my love for the west coast weather, the art community and my love to create and tell stories. On a smaller scale, I could either stay home because I'm afraid that I'll fall behind on class assignments, or I could go to Target because I love spending time with my roommates and going on spur-of-the-moment adventures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I'm trying to say is that I've noticed that I've been doing a lot more things out of love rather than fear. It has very much been a transition from me running from tiring responsbilities or anxiety-inducing situations to a reframed mindset where I am actively choosing to do things that are better for me and being able to say that it is okay to choose that over any facade in which I'm constantly trying to perfect for the sake others because, in essence, I have a fear that they won't see me the way I want them to see me. This has been something that I've noticed in so many of the people in my life and it's something that I hope everyone can come to understand. This isn't to say that you can only live a life of love because it's fear that has allowed the human race to survive for so long. It's a balance, but I believe that the way things are from the get-go in my generation leanns very heavily towards fear and I want to break that cycle.

                        Moral of the story: do more things because you love them.
