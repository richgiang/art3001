                        As I've come to the natural conclusions of a few projects it honestly has left me kind of curious on where to go from here. I keep thinking about how great and productive this summer could be for me, but I haven't really taken any active steps towards making it happen. I think it's because I've been so caught up in my work, but that's just what I like to tell myself.

                        Something I'm concerned about are my summer plans. I've been looking to move to the west coast and pursue creative projects and elect not to take an internship this summer. I know it's a bit risky especially if I end up not accomplishing a lot of my goals. But, on the other hand this seems like the perfect opportunity to do it and I've been listening to a few mentors say that they wished they had done this in college.

                    <p>
                        The biggest concern for me is cost since I won't have any income during my time. I do have STEP fellowship money to use but it would probably only cover about half of my total rent. I'd be okay spending the money to cover the rest of my rent since I have money saved up from last year from doing a remote internship, but still feel a bit anxious on spending money while not making any. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I digress, I still think that this is an opportunity to live in a city by myself and be completely creatively free and get as much done for my portfolio as I can before my final year of college starts, so I'm okay with it, but I am not in love with the cost of rent on the west coast (particularly, I like the idea of living in Seattle). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With that being said, because of this class I feel as though a large part of what I'm going to be doing this summer is creative coding. I've always wanted to get into livestreaminng so I was thinking about coding simple websites for local businesses for free on a livestream this summer in Seattle so I can make something my portfolio while giving back to the community! I have so many ideas for the projects I want to take on while in Seattle and get super excited while thinking about it and I see this summer as a launching point. Hopefully, this summer will propel and motivate me to continue this work and really discover what my career will end up looking like.

                        So, really, in conclusiom I feel like I'm at the precipice of a lot of change in my life and I recognize that I've been here before, but this time feels different in that I'm actually pepared to take the change head on and accept it into my life! If you have any advice on what you've done in a similar situation I'd love to hear it!
