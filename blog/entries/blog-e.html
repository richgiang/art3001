                       This past week I kind of took the time to pause in anticipation of our first instructional break. I wanted to pause and think about how I want to move forward with the rest of the semester. I have been working very hard lately on most of my projects and classwork, however, I feel like I have been doing a lot of th same things. At the beginning of the semester I did a lot of goal making and planning, but alas I have not really done any of it.

                       I think a big reason for that is the fact that I have to do so much to maintain a good level of mental and physical health because there is so much going against it that I have to make up a lot of ground. Not that there is anything wrong with it, I'm just having to re-evaluate the way that I approach the work that I have time to do and restructure my priorities. I'm realizing that I have to adapt to the projects that I have to do and yet still remember my persona projects.

                       With that being said, it has been interesting thinking about the future and how that may play out with my goals. I know that I don't have a lot of free time now, so I'm realizing that this summer will be the next time I have a lot of free time (and possibly the last), so I want to be very intentional with it. As I'm working on Project 1 I see that I'm enjoying long-term projects that I can work on my own time (and that I need to do work to make up for lost time to add to the portfolio that I'm creating). Essentially, I've decided that I'm going against the grain this summer and just taking time to create and make as many things as possible before I have to start looking for jobs.

                       My cofusion, I believe, has been stemming from what I actually want to get out of the rest of the semester. I feel as though I should be making the most of it, but to be honest I'm quite tired. In <u>Grit</u> Angela Duckworth has been talking about the themes of resilience and what not, but I want to know what she thinks about burnout, because that is something that I'm always grappling with and on the cusp of.
