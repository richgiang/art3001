                        I have been overthinking for as long as I have been aware of my own thinking at all. It honestly is just the worst thing ever. Well I don't want to be dramatic but I can't even think about what life would be like if I didn't overthink (but then again that could be like overthinking it). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        People all around me throughout my entire life have applauded and encouraged my observation and critical thinkinng skills. What they don't know is that I literally don't have a choice. I'm constantly thinking about every possibility of every situation because of my generalized anxiety that has been instilled in me for a very long time. My parents both have levels of generalized anxiety and most likely some form of obsesssive compulsive disorder (this is just my conjecture based on what I've learned about mental illnesses over the years, lord knows my immigrant parents would never seek formal help in this department). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With all of these unhealthy practices instilled in me through intergenerational trauma (at no fault of my parents, but really just the world's if you think about it), I have been super conflicted over how to bridge the gap between what I have learned over the last 7 years of my life about mental health and the mold that was formed over the past 20 years. It has been a struggle trying to reconcile with that I have learned is "right" and what I have believed is "right" as a result of negative thinking.

                        This year is the first year that I've really had time to reflect on the way I think and approach situations (I feel like this blog has very much just been me thinking about what I've uncovered about myself over the last year). With all of that thinking I have realized that I have gained a sort of dependence on others that coincides with my overthinking. I rely heavily on others for feedback which in turn feeds back into my overthinking and all of that results in quite the negative feedback loop. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've grown into an unhealthy reliance on the feedback of others which is great when it's good feedback, but it's not worth it when I get negative or ambiguous feedback that leaves me questioning everything. To be honest, even positive feedback messes with me when it contradicts my own interpretation of that particular situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fact that I can now recognize this, I believe it's step one in being able to reverse that thinkinng and unlearn it. I was never taught how to validate my own actions and be comfortable in what I fully believe in. However, I've been slowly forced over the last three years to make decisions for myself and only myself. Independence is something that I've thought I've had and been proud of, but now I realize that I'm only independent with regard to basic functions (i.e., feeding myself, traveling, etc.) and not at all independent in thought. I think that if I can get over this lack of independence it would be a big breakthrough for me that would open the door for even more growth.

                    <p>
                        In short, I think it's okay to admit you were wrong about a belief you've held for so long. The sunk cost fallacy doesn't apply to any situation, and especially situations that take up a lot of mental space and personal history. Really, I think everyone should take a long look at their past, empathize with both your past self and current self, decide what to remember and what to let go, then move forward motivated and revitalized.
