            I think I need more grit?
             </h4>
            <p>
                These past few weeks of being couped up in my house has led me to do a lot of self-reflection. I also think it helps that I've been reading the #1 New York Times Bestseller <u>Grit</u> by Angela Duckworth. But I've come to the conclusion that I need more grit in life in general. It is something I have always noticed in passing whenever I undertake projects. In high school I had a mentor who deemed it "Squirrel Syndrome" and because of that I always just passed it off as just that. However, now I realize that that was me just not wanting to face the fact that I needed a lot of work in terms of stickig with and following through on projects. I'm someone who doesn't really stick with long-term complex projects unless I have to for school or work. However, with this semester and the circumstances I've been presented with it kind of seems like the best opportunity to kill this habit and behavior before it affects my future negatively and permanently. 
                <br>
                Part of the circumstances I've been presented with is this class and specifically the projects. Working on Exercise 3 has motivated me to take what I learn inn this class far beyond the end of the semester. I plan on taking the summer to learn as much as I can in the areas I'm interested in, create as much as possible, and really just hone my narrrative. 
                <br>
                These past three years I've taken a lot of time to figure out my "why" and what Angela Duckworth calls my "compass". It's something that gives me direction and I've discovered that mastery oveer web design and internet art is a mid-tier goal that will help me achieve my top-level goal. 
                <br>
                With that being said, what I'm currently doing to work towards that goal is take a lot of time on Project 1 to get it right and really put 100% of my efforts possible into creating something that I can really be proud of. I'm genuinely interested in how I can truly reflect who I am in the portfolio as well as the final project. The habit of putting all of myself into everythinng I create is definitely something I want to adopt before the summer, so I'll start with this.
