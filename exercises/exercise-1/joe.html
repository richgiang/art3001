    <h1>Joe</h1>
    <p>
        Joe is a ball of chaos that could be cooking chicken <br> hearts at one minute and mixing absinthe with champagne the next. <br> He's someone that eerily looks like JFK and has similar political aspirations. <br> While Joe is a man of many talents, he's no gym rat. 
        <br> 
        <br>
        For context, the scale was found in a million pieces in our basement <br> which has all of our workout equipment. We're inferring that a weight was dropped on it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Following simple logic, if Joe doesn't lift and a weight <br> was dropped on it, we can rule Joe out.
