    <h1>Ryan</h1>
    <p>
        Ryan is the one that reported the murder - I mean broken scale. Logic would follow that he wouldn't turn himself in.
        <br>
        <br>
        Or would he?
        <br>
        Oh, no he's bleeding because he kneeled on the glass, he wouldn't do that to himself.
        <br>
        <br>
        Or would he?
        <br>
        <br>
        I don't know man, he's kinda hardcore
        <br>
        <br>
        Now, he says he's going to get to the bottom of this one way or another.
        <br>
        <br>
        He invited us to the basement to <a href="../exercise-1/investigate.html">investigate.</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <a href="../exercise-1/suspects.html">Alright we'll trust him for now.</a>
