            In sixth grade Mrs. Walker<br>
            slapped the back of my head<br>
            and made me stand in the corner<br>
            for not knowing the difference<br>
            between persimmon and precision.<br>
            How to choose <br> <br> persimmons. 
            This is precision. <br>
            Ripe ones are soft and brown-spotted.<br>
            Sniff the bottoms. The sweet one<br>
            will be fragrant. How to eat:<br>
            put the knife away, lay down newspaper.<br>
            Peel the skin tenderly, not to tear the meat.<br>
            Chew the skin, suck it,<br>
            and swallow. Now, eat<br>
            the meat of the fruit,<br>
            so sweet,<br>
            all of it, to the heart.<br>
            <br>
            Donna undresses, her stomach is white.<br>
            In the yard, dewy and shivering<br>
            with crickets, we lie naked,<br>
            face-up, face-down.<br>
            I teach her Chinese.<br>
            Crickets: chiu chiu. Dew: I’ve forgotten.<br>
            Naked:   I’ve forgotten.<br>
            Ni, wo:   you and me.<br>
            I part her legs,<br>
            remember to tell her<br>
            she is beautiful as the moon.<br>
            <br>
            Other words
            that got me into trouble were<br>
            fight and fright, wren and yarn.<br>
            Fight was what I did when I was frightened,<br>
            Fright was what I felt when I was fighting.<br>
            Wrens are small, plain birds,<br>
            yarn is what one knits with.<br>
            Wrens are soft as yarn.<br>
            My mother made birds out of yarn.<br>
            I loved to watch her tie the stuff;<br>
            a bird, a rabbit, a wee man.<br>
            <br>
            Mrs. Walker brought a persimmon to class<br>
            and cut it up<br>
            so everyone could taste<br>
            a Chinese apple. Knowing<br>
            it wasn’t ripe or sweet, I didn’t eat<br>
            but watched the other faces.<br>
            <br>
            My mother said every persimmon has a sun<br>
            inside, something golden, glowing,<br>
            warm as my face.<br>
            <br>
            Once, in the cellar, I found two wrapped in newspaper,<br>
            forgotten and not yet ripe.<br>
            I took them and set both on my bedroom windowsill,<br>
            where each morning a cardinal<br>
            sang, The sun, the sun.<br>
            <br>
            Finally understanding <br>
            he was going blind, <br>
            my father sat up all one night <br>
            waiting for a song, a ghost. <br>
            I gave him the persimmons, <br>
            swelled, heavy as sadness, <br>
            and sweet as love. <br>
            <br>
            This year, in the muddy lighting <br>
            of my parents’ cellar, I rummage, looking <br>
            for something I lost. <br>
            My father sits on the tired, wooden stairs, <br>
            black cane between his knees, <br>
            hand over hand, gripping the handle. <br>
            He’s so happy that I’ve come home. <br>
            I ask how his eyes are, a stupid question. <br>
            All gone, he answers. <br>
            <br>
            Under some blankets, I find a box. <br>
            Inside the box I find three scrolls. <br>
            I sit beside him and untie <br>
            three paintings by my father: <br>
            Hibiscus leaf and a white flower. <br>
            Two cats preening. <br>
            Two persimmons, so full they want to drop from the cloth. <br>
            <br>
            He raises both hands to touch the cloth, <br>
            asks, Which is this? <br>
            <br>
            This is persimmons, Father. <br>
            <br>
            Oh, the feel of the wolftail on the silk, <br>
            the strength, the tense <br>
            precision in the wrist. <br>
            I painted them hundreds of times <br>
            eyes closed. These I painted blind. <br>
            Some things never leave a person: <br>
            scent of the hair of one you love, <br>
            the texture of persimmons, <br>
            in your palm, the ripe weight. <br>
